## Description

In this Challenge, I used the Express, Sequelize and MySQL2 node packages along with a MySQL database to create the backend for an E-Commerce site connected to a MySQL database which can be used to view add update and delete the products, tags, and categories of products available on the site. It utilizes node.js and sequelize in order to handle and store the product data and can take in input to add, update and remove the product data as needed.

## Languages

- JavaScript
- Node.js
- MySQL
- Sequelize
- Insomnia Core

## Deployment
